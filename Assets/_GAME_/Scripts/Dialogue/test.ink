- You discover a note left by your mentor.
My dear apprentice, I'm so glad you have discovered the note I left for you.
As I write this message, I am about to be captured by the Draconic cult.
I am sure they have taken me to their secret lair by the time you are reading this.
In order to defeat them, you must conquer all three of the surrounding dungeons.
I believe your first step should be the dungeon located in the forest to the left of this lab...
I wish you luck on your journey. The world is counting on you.

    -> END
